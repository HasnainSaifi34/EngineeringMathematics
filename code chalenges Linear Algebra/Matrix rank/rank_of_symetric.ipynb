    "To understand the equality of ranks in the context of a matrix $ A $, let’s break down the properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Rank of $ A $ and $ A^T $**:\n",
    "   The rank of a matrix is defined as the maximum number of linearly independent rows (or columns) in the matrix. For any matrix $ A $, the rank of $ A $ is equal to the rank of its transpose $ A^T $. This is because transposing a matrix does not change the number of linearly independent rows or columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "   $\n",
    "   \\text{rank}(A) = \\text{rank}(A^T)\n",
    "   $\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Rank of $ AA^T $ and $ A^TA $**:\n",
    "   When you multiply a matrix $ A $ by its transpose $ A^T $, or $ A^T $ by $ A $, the result is a symmetric matrix. Let’s examine why these ranks are equal to the rank of $ A $.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Rank of $ AA^T $**:\n",
    "     The matrix $ AA^T $ is a square matrix that is formed by multiplying $ A $ with its transpose. The rank of $ AA^T $ is equal to the rank of $ A $. This can be shown as follows:\n",
    "     - $ AA^T $ is a symmetric matrix whose rank is limited by the rank of $ A $.\n",
    "     - The columns of $ AA^T $ span the same space as the columns of $ A $, so the rank of $ AA^T $ is the same as the rank of $ A $.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Rank of $ A^TA $**:\n",
    "     Similarly, $ A^TA $ is also a symmetric matrix, and its rank is equal to the rank of $ A $. This is because:\n",
    "     - $ A^TA $ is a projection matrix onto the column space of $ A $.\n",
    "     - The rank of $ A^TA $ is also limited by the rank of $ A $.\n",
    "\n",
    "   $\n",
    "   \\text{rank}(AA^T) = \\text{rank}(A)\n",
    "   $\n",
    "   $\n",
    "   \\text{rank}(A^TA) = \\text{rank}(A)\n",
    "   $\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Equality of Ranks**:\n",
    "   To summarize, the rank of the matrix $ A $ is the same as the ranks of $ A^T $, $ AA^T $, and $ A^TA $. This follows from the properties of matrix multiplication and transposition:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $\n",
    "   \\text{rank}(A) = \\text{rank}(A^T) = \\text{rank}(AA^T) = \\text{rank}(A^TA)\n",
    "   $\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, these equalities are based on the fact that the rank of a product of matrices is limited by the rank of the factors, and the product of a matrix with its transpose or its transpose with itself still captures the same dimensionality of the row or column space of the original matrix $ A $."
